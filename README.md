# Tick tock diaper

## Instructions

Lets face it: babies poop. As a parent you cannot run away from it. Practice makes perfection, so let's get ready. 

These babies need your help. If you see a baby sitting, it only means one thing: Poop is on the way! Run towards him/her to quickly change the diaper. But be careful!!! other babies are still moving and can diaperize you with just a touch. 

After changing some diapers, you will develop a hidden power...  Change as much as you can to discover it! 

May the diaper be with you.


### Further Improvements

[] To remove obstacles from the baord after they are created to improve playability

[] To avoid colision when the obstacles shows up in the same position as the player

[] To improve the responsiveness of the game, so that the window doesn't scroll down when playing

[] Player flips when going left or right.
