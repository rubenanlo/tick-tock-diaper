[] The use of OOP, arrays, ternary operators, conditional statements (e.g., if, switch), loops, DOM manipulation, among other technical related aspects.


### Instructions

Lets face it: babies poop. As a parent you cannot run away from it. Practice makes perfection, so let's get ready. 

These babies need your help. If you see a baby sitting, it only means one thing: Poop is on the way! Run towards him/her to quickly change the diaper. But be careful!!! other babies are still moving and can diaperize you with just a touch. 

After changing some diapers, you will develop a hidden power...  Change as much as you can to discover it! 

May the diaper be with you.



### Further updates

[] To remove obstacles from the board after they are created to improve playability.

[] To avoid colision when the obstacles shows up in the same position as the player.

[] To increase the time out for the 'diaperize' button.
