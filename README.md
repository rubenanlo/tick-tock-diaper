# Tick tock diaper

## Instructions

Lets face it: babies poop. As a parent you cannot run away from it. Practice makes perfection, so let's get ready. 

These babies need your help. If you see a baby stopping, it only means one thing: he/she has pooped. Run towards him/her to quickly change the diaper. But be careful!!! other babies are still moving and can diaperize you with just touching you. 

After changing some diapers, you will develop a hidden power. Change as much as you can to discover it!. 

May the diaper be with you.


### Further Improvements

Implementation of a kill them all button which will change the diaper to all babies moving and fixed.
