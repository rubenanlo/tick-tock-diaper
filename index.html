        <p> Lets face it: babies poop. As a parent you cannot run away from it. Practice makes perfection, so let's get ready. <br> <br> These babies need your help. If you see a baby raising his/her hand, it only means one thing: Poop is on the way! Run towards him/her to quickly change the diaper. But be careful!!! other babies are still moving and can diaperize you with just a touch. <br> <br>After changing some diapers, you will develop a hidden power...  Change as much as you can to discover it!. <br> <br>May the diaper be with you.
        </p>
